## Full-stack AI engineer profile (polished blurb)

**AI development | Workflow Automation | LLMs | RAG | Image AI | Voice AI | Full Stack | (Open-source first)**

I’m an AI and Fullstack Engineer specializing in **LLM integration**, **autonomous/multi-agent systems**, **workflow automation**, and **multimodal AI (voice + vision)**. I build production-grade systems that connect models with APIs, databases, business logic, and cloud/DevOps infrastructure—delivering measurable outcomes (often cutting manual ops by **30–90%** across finance, healthcare, civil engineering, and recruitment).

### AI / LLM engineering
- **Workflow automation & LLM integration**: built pipelines connecting **Slack → Notion → internal APIs → LLMs**, reducing support/response time by **~60%**
- **RAG pipelines**: vector DBs + **hybrid search** + custom retrievers for accurate, context-aware responses in production
- **Autonomous & multi-agent systems**: ReAct-style agents and orchestration with **LangChain / LangGraph / AutoGen / CrewAI**, plus model integrations (e.g., GPT-class models, DeepSeek-class models)
- **AI content detection & moderation**: stylometric analysis + embedding similarity + fine-tuned transformer classifiers to identify AI-generated text with high precision
- **Multimodal (vision)**: image tagging/moderation pipelines using **CLIP + YOLOv8** on **AWS Lambda/S3**, filtering thousands of images/day (e-commerce workflows)
- **Multimodal (voice)**: **Whisper** ASR + **Tacotron2**-style TTS/voice cloning to build personalized voice assistants with CRM/IVR integration (e.g., Twilio/Vapi-style stacks where applicable)
- **Bots**: trading bots, Discord bots, and intelligent automation bots across multiple platforms/sites
- **Multimodal products**: generative ad/video workflows, lip-syncing avatars, OCR/visual search pipelines

### Full stack, mobile, and infrastructure
- **Web**: Next.js/React/Vue  
- **Backend**: Node.js/NestJS/FastAPI/Django/Ruby on Rails/Laravel  
- **Mobile**: React Native/Expo, Flutter, Swift, Kotlin  
- **Data**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Supabase (and other managed DBs as needed)  
- **Cloud/DevOps**: AWS/Azure, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD
- **Automation**: n8n, Zapier, Make.com, and custom API workflows

### Note on tooling
Open-source first for core components; pragmatic about using best-available tools when they materially improve quality/safety/time-to-ship—including advanced AI methods, and “quantum” only when it is genuinely relevant to the problem constraints.
